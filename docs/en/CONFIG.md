## Fork taskbar appearance

Desktop widget options are legacy and ignored in this fork. `general.panel_locked` locks both dragging and automatic positioning; old `window.locked` migrates when the new field is absent. `general.panel_position_x` is the taskbar-relative horizontal DIP coordinate. Off migrates to the panel and legacy Bars to the weekly tray ring.

`[appearance]` defaults:

```toml
ring_color = "#FF3774"
number_color = "auto" # or #RRGGBB
ring_size = 28 # 12–44 DIP
ring_thickness = 4 # 1–12, less than half the diameter
ring_x = 8 # 0–300 DIP from panel left
ring_y = 0 # −20–20 DIP from centered position
number_size = 20 # 10–40 DIP ink height
number_x = 43 # 0–300 DIP from panel left
number_y = 0 # −20–20 DIP from centered position
number_weight = "semibold" # regular / semibold / bold
symbol_percent = 60 # 40–100, relative to digit size
```

Right-click Appearance settings for live preview; Save persists, Cancel/close rolls back. Vertical offsets stay inside the taskbar. Outdated/missing data retains muted state styling. The tray uses the same ring hue and relative thickness within the system-controlled icon size. The following upstream widget options are retained only for configuration compatibility.

# CONFIG.md — the configuration file

Location: `%APPDATA%\AiLimits\config.toml`. Created automatically on the
first launch; every context-menu change is persisted here. Unknown fields
and providers are ignored (old configs never break parsing). On a parse
error the widget logs a warning and falls back to the defaults.

Next to it the widget may keep `provider-cache.json` (last known metrics
with a future reset — they survive restarts), `history.jsonl` (bounded usage history feeding the
Expanded sparkline) and, when `AILIMITS_LOG` or `RUST_LOG` is set,
`ailimits.log`.

## Full example

This fork also supports `[network] proxy_mode = "system"` (default) or
`"direct"`. The Network proxy menu applies changes to the next request.
System mode follows reqwest's environment/Windows static-proxy rules;
PAC/WPAD is not supported. System setting changes are detected automatically;
environment changes outside the running process require a restart.

## Secrets

The config never holds keys or tokens — only labels. The actual values live
in the Windows Credential Manager under service `ailimits`:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `claude_api_key` | Claude API key (the api_key method) |
| `claude_usage_token` | manual Claude subscription usage token |
| `codex_usage_token` | manual ChatGPT/Codex usage token |
| `copilot_pat` | GitHub PAT (used instead of the gh CLI) |

The Rust structs live in `src/config/schema.rs` — that file is the single
source of truth for the schema.
